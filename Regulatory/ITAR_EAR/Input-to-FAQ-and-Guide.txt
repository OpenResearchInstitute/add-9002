# Input to FAQ/Guide

Development of a FAQ/Guide for ITAR/EAR regulatory results was begun on 9 September 2021. Below are the input questions and objections used to draft the FAQ/Guide, along some proposed answers that arose from the discussion. Solicitation of input will continue indefinitely, and any new material, whether from a new FAQ or from new legal results, will be incorporated into the FAQ/Guide. The FAQ/Guide will be written by ORI with the legal assistance of Thomsen & Burke LLC. 

## Subjective Issues

### Non-English Names

A comment I received mostly from legacy defense industry persons concerning any discussion of technical issues that could be covered under ITAR  is that they are hesitant to open up with most individuals that have non-english names. It’s an anachronism I guess, but it happened more than once. Once they are explained it becomes easier. This spans professors to industry experts.

### Personal Attacks

A number of personal attacks have been made about this work. Personal animus towards ORI and the team that did the work has been revealed over time. Irrational and emotional reactions against the authors and the work have resulted in poor decision-making within the organizations that would greatly benefit from the work. 

### Personal Attacks (Proposed Solution)

No FAQ can fix hate. Focus on healthy organizations and communities. 

## Objective Issues

### Regulatory Results are Too Narrowly Defined

The work doesn't apply to anything outside of exactly what's mentioned in the CJ request, so it's useless to anyone else.

### Training Requirements for Participants

Yes, ORI work can be ITAR-exempt, but will there be a training program for ORI community (and will it be mandatory) as to what to do so that we protect the ITAR-exemptions? 

### Prohibitions on Speech

Under the new guidance, what actions will still be prohibited with regards to discussing/collaborating on amateur radio satellite projects and with who?

If I put information on a satellite project up on a web page, then can I discuss it with someone from another country? What if they ask a question about something related to my project that is beyond tbe scope of what is written on the webpage? Do I need to revise the information on the website? If so, how long do I have to make revisions?

### Prohibitions on Individuals from Specific Countries

Does this mean we can now talk to anyone about any amateur radio satellite work?  What can you discuss if the other person is not an American citizen? (say they are English, or Canadian or North Korean or Chinese)?

### 2012 Defense Act

The 2012 national defense re-authorization act means nothing you've done is legal.

### Requirements on Screening Materials

Will it include the fact that all material must go through a screening process (regular) to eliminate non-permitted material that could have ITAR connection with ORI programs, or is the default assumption going forward to be : if it is not specified, then assume it is not covered under ITAR.

### Border Patrol Checkpoints while Carrying Data 

The worst possible scenario: ORI community member downloads information (doing research) and  (assuming no bad intentions also has ITAR information access that is authorized) then keeps ITAR work and non-ITAR work on same laptop. THEN goes through a CBP checkpoint who want to see that laptop. It has happened before … https://www.crowell.com/NewsEvents/AlertsNewsletters/all/Managing-Hand-Carry-Export-Import-Pitfalls and warnings exist (such as https://www.colorado.edu/researchinnovation/ori-compliance/export-controls/guidance/international-travel) to avoid incidents enumerated in the sobering US gov’t publication https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/documents/enforcement/1005-don-t-let-this-happen-to-you-1/file

So, in the above complex scenario (happened to me at LAX inbound) what will happen/where is the “line” drawn?

What about a totally FN (sorry, NASA speak for Foreign National) – arriving in the US for ORI work on (business? Pleasure? Visa) and is asked at the CBP checkpoint are you carrying any electronic devices (happened to me many times when I was not a US green card holder) and what I did – and (1993, 2003, 2004, 2005) the moment I said I was  an (satcom/telecom/space etc.)  engineer, it was a guaranteed search of my belongings. Hey, 1993 – the greyhound bus that transported me from Vancouver, BC to Seattle, WA was held as they searched my bags for whatever .. as I came from a technical conference.

### Notice Requirements

Would it be therefore useful to have a clear legal statement on any ORI project top level documentation and folder tree (I did this for a NASA project intellectual property transfer, from the university to a designated official) which outlines what / why  / who / where and the name of an authorized ITAR compliance specialist so that the ORI community member knows who to refer queries to and can protect themselves by following the checklist.

### Checklist

Why not then, create a ORI community checklist for ITAR compliance that can be filled out online for any new reference materials and kept in a record? 

I wonder if  an ITAR compliance checklist (a check off style web form) for contributors could be used when they upload/share content? At the very least it could contain a public URL / bibliography / citation of research materials utilized in a project. Could also be a free form submission – though that would be harder to keep track of.

### Checklist (Proposed Answer)

"Check before you upload" is based on the idea that you are safe until
you publish the information. The opposite is true. Allowing something
to be secret is what gets you in trouble.

The lawyers can tell you:
1. How we said we would publish information.
2. What we said were the capabilities of satellites in our satellite
program, because certain capabilities are prohibited (for example,
imaging the State of Israel at a greater resolution than available
commercially outside of the United States - see
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyl%E2%80%93Bingaman_Amendment ).

But mainly this long, expensive process confirmed our understanding of
what you could clearly read in the text of ITAR and EAR, if people
just took the time to read them. A J.D. is not required. And all of
that doubt was from people who never read the text and just wanted to
doubt.

### One Simple Rule

Is there one simple rule of thumb that can be relied on to keep you out of trouble with ITAR/EAR?

### One Simple Rule (Proposed Answer)

Essentially the rule is absolutely everything has to be done in the public.
