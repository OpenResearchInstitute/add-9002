celebration of a successful launch 
goddard space flight
was unmanned
delta launch vehicle
nasa had taken over from air force for launches
NASA to noaa
tigris m, then ICOS 1 when in space
by teaming up with the delta program we benefited
they wanted to launch everything, including us. 
I built this s/c, I'd like to launch this
and they did.
so, there things like the center director was a ham W3GYU 
the guy at NOAA was a ham W3PRB
etc etc etc
They had the FCC wired
legitimate perspectives: there were tensions at play
all legitimate considerations
how to play this
whether or not to accept it. 
bunch of young kids that knew what they were doing
delta wanted to be the workhorse so they needed to launch everything they could
secondary, international, everyone
the weather program had another a problem.
critical demo, important part
how hurricanes moved in the caribbean. This was really important. 
Satellites are in garage, Corona phasing down, getting more classified, and requested formally through the delta project, applied for a radio license, ITU, etc.
delta project office assisted them. But they had to build it. 
Quick technical presentation and then others presented. Money approval story. 
lots of conditions and then they were busy doing tests
we didn't cause any risk for that launch
primary batteries, not rechargeable
diplomatic missions

First educational/university satellite
