### San Bernardino Microwave Society report

Plan to present at SBMS meeting 2 September 2021. Due to some a/v challenges at the meeting, our presentation was made during the social hour after the meeting. Brief update about ORI's work was made, lots of great questions answered, and a speaker invited to our Space and Satellite Symposium on 30 October 2021. We've been asked to submit an article for the SBMS newsletter.

### Space and Satellite Symposium planning and progress

There's still room for additional presenters, but space is filling. Preliminary schedule is in progress. 

### Regulatory

Successful Regulatory Results for Open Source Amateur Satellite Work

On 2 September, 2021, Open Research Institute (ORI) received an advisory opinion from US Commerce Department BIS.

The letter confirmed that posting information on the internet so that it is available to the public means that open source amateur satellite communications work is not subject to the Export Administration Regulation (EAR). Prior work by ORI established that open source amateur satellite communications work was free of International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR).

This is a significant regulatory success for open source amateur satellite work and open source in general.

Work was funded by ARDC and executed by Open Research Institute. Legal assistance was provided by Thomsen and Burke LLP.

All documents and links to presentations about the work are freely available at https://github.com/phase4ground/documents/tree/master/Regulatory

*Thank you so much* to everyone that has helped with this. We should not understate or underestimate how important this is for ORI to continue freely operating.
