## Link Budget Work

Many of us in the amateur satellite community are familiar with Jan King's link budget spreadsheets. 

Jan has an updated version that includes many additions for Open Research Institute's microwave broadband digital DVB-S2/X transponder work.

The current version of this spreadsheet can be found here:

And a video walkthrough, recorded on 12 May 2021 with Michelle Thompson and Wally Ritchie as the audience, can be found here:

Note: This is a long video! It walks through the entire spreadsheet. There's action items and changes that are discussed in the video. Essential functionality and overall structure will stay the same as the spreadsheet is updated. 

For an introduction to the open source amateur satellite system that this link budget is being developed for, please see the introduction to this video presentation.

## Form 990 Mailed

Our IRS Form 990 was completed this week, with the help of multiple participants and volunteers. Thank you to everyone that contributed towards filling it out and reviewing it. 

## M17 Banking 

The ARDC grant for M17 Project was received, deposited, and M17 staff members began the process of getting access to funds so that they can start work. Welcome to M17! 

## Remote Labs

### CHONC

_Cubic Heavy Open Number Center_ is the San Diego Lab PC. It has been installed in Remote Lab West and is accessible to remote lab users. An Ubuntu VM was built yesterday. The DVB-S2 cards have not yet been installed. The system uses Unraid to manage different environments and is capable of handling almost any computing job we may have. 

### Multimedia Beacon

As suggested by Ron Economos W6RZ, a multimedia DVB-S2 beacon will be put on the air as soon as possible. Goals are to make an easily duplicatable design that allows experimenters to work with the same type of signal used for P4DX downlink. As of today, the design is a Raspberry Pi 4 running GNU Radio flowgraph from Ron W6RZ, a BladeRF or HackRF, and an amplifier. Content transmitted will be both file and camera data to show the potential for the multiplexed signal. 

### NiCd Matched Cells

Battery analysis for NiCd matched cells, Douglas Quagliana principal investigator, began trial runs of data collection on donated cells. A new set of probes was ordered from Vencon. These arrived on 14 May 2021. We welcome a new volunteer, Michael "Lab Tech 1" Easton KK6OOZ, to the project. He will be responsible for battery tests and data collection, storage, and publishing. A paper and presentation will be made when the project is complete. We expect to test a large number of cells, on the order of 120, that will purchased as a batch.
