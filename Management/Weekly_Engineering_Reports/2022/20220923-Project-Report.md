## Ham Expo Presentations and Exhibits

### We presented five talks at Ham Expo September 2022. 

#### Ribbit, a new digital text messaging mode for UHF/VHF emergency communications
Presentors:
Pierre Deliou W4CKX, Ahmet Inan

Level: General Audience
Category: Emergency Communications
Time:

   PDT: September 18, 2022, 10:00 am
   UTC: September 18, 2022, 5:00 pm

Ribbit is a novel digital text messaging mode for VHF/UHF communications for recreational and emergency use which radically increases the density of information transmitted by spectrum used. It leverages the computing power of the modern smartphone to increase the capabilities of any Handy Talkie without requiring any additional hardware. Its redundant distributed nature allows it to function even when connectivity to the internet is lost during emergencies. Ribbit is open source and currently in its early stages of development.

#### Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning and the Future of Amateur Radio
Level: Intermediate
Category: DSP and Software Design, Future of Amateur Radio, SDR Software Defined Radio, Software and Services
Time:

   PDT: September 17, 2022, 1:00 pm
   UTC: September 17, 2022, 8:00 pm

Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are all over the news, taking over academia, getting billions of dollars of commercial investment, and will change both computer networking and wireless communications in fundamental ways. What does the future of amateur radio look like when radios use machine learning to operate? How does our relationship to the bands change with cognitive radio? Where are we in this transformation? What will happen next?

#### Truly Excellent Digital Voice Quality: Opulent Voice
Presentors:
Paul Williamson KB5MU

Level: General Audience
Category: Digital Voice Mode, DSP and Software Design, Software and Satellites, Space and Satellites
Time:

   PDT: September 17, 2022, 9:00 am
   UTC: September 17, 2022, 4:00 pm

Digital voice on amateur radio to date has generally had terrible voice quality, due to both a perception of limited available bandwidth and the convenience (to manufacturers) of repurposing commercial protocols with their older, proprietary, low-bitrate voice codecs. We present and demonstrate a modern digital voice design that can be used on 222 MHz and above with truly excellent voice quality.

#### Haifuraiya - Open Source HEO Satellite Project Proposal
Presentors:
Michelle Thompson W5NYV

Level: General Audience
Category: Space and Satellites
Time:

   PDT: September 18, 2022, 9:00 am
   UTC: September 18, 2022, 4:00 pm

Haifuraiya is an open source highly elliptical orbit amateur satellite project proposal. This presentation will walk through the high-level project proposal. The project features a digital microwave multiplexing transceiver with a failover transponder mode, has an international volunteer team open to community participants, and complies with debris mitigation guidance from the United States Federal Communications Commission.

#### User Authentication for Amateur Satellites
Presentors:
Paul Williamson KB5MU

Level: General Audience
Category: DSP and Software Design, Software and Satellites, Space and Satellites
Time:

   PDT: September 17, 2022, 8:00 am
   UTC: September 17, 2022, 3:00 pm

After a brief discussion of the reasons why user authentication is needed on an amateur satellite service system, we'll cover a proposed system to implement reasonably secure user authentication on a P4XT digital multiplexing satellite transponder, within the bounds of the (United States) rules.

### We had three project showcases in the Project Gallery

Each Gallery had a Q&A tab, a poster or document, links to any papers, and a link to any associated video presentations. 

#### Ribbit, a distributed digital messaging platform

#### Opulent Voice - High Bitrate Digital Voice and Data

#### Open Source Satellite Work is Free of ITAR/EAR

### Kumospace Lounge

Thank you to Ham Expo for providing fun and effective Lounges for interaction at the conference. We truly enjoyed visiting with everyone that dropped by. 


## FPGA 

### Downlink Transmitter

Progress reported on MQTT build for the downlink. 

### Uplink Receiver

Simple FSK receiver design described at weekly meeting. Video recording link here: https://youtu.be/CohOaRs0RYA (last week) and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-FXbU_Vys (this week). 

## Haifuraiya

We met with JAMSAT about the Open Source HEO proposal at their monthly membership meeting for September. The proposal will be in the JAMSAT Journal next issue or so, translated. Best place to track published work for the project is https://github.com/phase4ground/documents/tree/master/Papers_Articles_Presentations/Slide_Presentations/haifuraiya
