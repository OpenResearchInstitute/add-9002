## Weekly Report

### FOSDEM

Submitted a talk to FOSDEM "Introducing the M17 Project". Wrote script, had script reviewed, recorded audio, edited video, rendered video, and uploaded to FOSDEM conference server.

### End-to-End P4XT demo

Problem with types in ports. STD_LOGIC and STD_LOGIC_VECTOR are the only ones Vivado likes, and not all of the files for dvbs2_encoder module were copied over and the .tcl script that handles wrapping the types in STD_LOGIC and STD_LOGIC_VECTOR was not used properly. Reference design is from Analog Devices and allows AXI blocks to be intergrated into the ADRV9371 radio board on the zc706.
