## Weekly Report

### FOSDEM

Submitted a talk to (Free and Open Source Developers' European Meeting) FOSDEM "Introducing the M17 Project". Wrote script, had script reviewed, recorded audio, edited video, rendered video, and uploaded to FOSDEM conference server. 

### Cubesat Developer's Workshop

Submitted abstract by Bruce Perens:

Open Research Institute has received determinations from the Department of State and the Department of Commerce permitting it to go forward with the development and production of fully Open Source satellites within the United States. The satellites and their associated ground and other equipment are not subject to ITAR and EAR. Their full documentation is being made available for anyone to download over the Internet. Their development is carried out through a multinational online collaboration that is not required to restrict participation by nationals of any nation. The legal work, by a respected Washington D.C. firm, and the resulting documents are available for other institutions to use a precedent and prototype in achieving a similar ITAR/EAR-Free Space Development.

Bruce Perens K6BP is one of the founders of the Open Source movement in software, co-founder of Open Research Institute and the initial developer of its ITAR/EAR strategy. Michelle Thompson W5NYV is CEO of Open Research Institute. She initiated the legal process and drove it to completion.

### End-to-End P4XT demo

Progress on integrating custom IP cores with the Analog Devices Hardware Descriptive Language Reference Design. This reference design is from Analog Devices and allows AXI blocks to be intergrated into the ADRV9371 radio board on the zc706. 

Problem with types in ports. STD_LOGIC and STD_LOGIC_VECTOR are the only ones Vivado likes, and not all of the files for dvbs2_encoder module were copied over and the .tcl script that handles wrapping the types in STD_LOGIC and STD_LOGIC_VECTOR was not used properly. Suoto explained that there is a tcl script that adjusts the port definitions.
