## Weekly Project Report

## Ham Expo March 2022

Andre Suoto presented "Deep dive of an FPGA Implementation of DVB-S2" and Ed Wilson and Steve Miller gave their "What is M17" talk. 

The keynote reception was held in our lounge. Keynote was by someone very familiar to us - Courtney Duncan N5BF. 

It was a real pleasure to be the host for Gerald Youngblood's talk "SDR ADC Overload Myth Debunked". 

These talks and 57 more will be available online in the near future, for free. They are free on the Ham Expo platform for registrants for the first 30 days after the event closes.

Our booth has had a brisk business and the videos and documents have been popular. We received a lot of compliments and appreciation today for both regulatory and technical work. All credit goes to all of you out there, who have contributed and supported a wide variety of work, all along the way. 

## Ham Expo possibly in September 2022

It may be that Ham Expo will move from August to September for the Autumn 2022 show. This would be fortunate for us, as the usual date for Ham Expo in Autumn would conflict with another event where we will exhibit (DEFCON).  

## DEFCON 30

Our next in-person will be DEFCON in mid-August 2022, where we'll demonstrate a variety of the things that we do, over the air. Planning is well underway and the organizers have been extremely supportive.

In between now and then, we have a lot of work to do! If you're not on Slack, or haven't checked in for a while, please drop by. Activity has steadily increased since HamCation and there are some major milestones that "are closer than they appear". 

## International Standardization for M17 Protocol
### Practical Open Source Engineering

Practical Open Source Engineering is a series of talks from the San Diego Chapter of Information Theory Society of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. 

Technologies do not grow and mature in isolation.  To maximize utilization, organizations often turn to ecosystems of partners to drive collaboration and integration of these technologies. One structured and proven way of establishing such an ecosystem is via standardization.  Standards provide vehicles to establish best-practices and define interfaces for compliance, allowing users to have confidence that the products they employ are safe, reliable, and are of good quality.  

M17 Project has developed a new digital radio protocol for data and voice, made by and for amateur radio operators.

The protocol's voice mode uses the free and open Codec 2 voice encoder. This means there are no patents, no royalties, and no licensing or legal barriers to scratch-building your own radio or modifying one you already own.

This freedom to build, understand, and innovate is core to amateur radio, but has been missing from the commercially available digital voice modes. This is part of why amateur radio digital voice modes have largely stagnated since the 1990s and we're almost wholly dependent on commercial products that aren't well designed for amateur radio users.

The presenter, Erin Bournival, is a Distinguished Engineer from the Office of the Corporate CTO at Dell Technologies. 

She is an experienced Technologist with a demonstrated history of working in the Information Technology industry. Skilled in system architecture, Virtualization, Storage, the Internet of Things, Digital Twin, and National/International Standards development, Erin illuminates the process of international standardization for a promising open source communications protocol called M17. 

## P4DX FPGA Work

There has been substantial progress in incorporating DVB-S2 encoder IP into the analog devices reference design for the 9371. An Analog Devices PLUTO SDR was added to Remote Lab West, a JTAG connector was soldered to the board, and JTAG adapter purchased and installed. PLUTO was successfully run under MATLAB. PLUTO was successfully programmed with the reduced-features DVB-S2 encoder. 

## AmbaSat Inspired Sensors

70 cm AmbaSat main board re-spin successful in the lab. An additional article has been shipped to Dr. Alan Johnston. An antenna for the sounding rocket test has been purchased.
