### M17 Talks and Demo

Thank you to everyone that attended the University of San Diego IEEE Student Branch Meeting on 3 May 2022 and the PARC/IEEE Information Theory Society Chapter event on 4 May 2022. Talks went well, with feedback incorporated for a final version to be recorded next week. The talk is about the forward error correction in M17.

The demonstration was MD-380 HTs running OpenRTX firmware and a PLUTO running M17 flowgraph from GNU Radio. An audio file was played from the PLUTO. Another monitoring station was an SDR with OpenWebRX receiving M17. Demonstration was successful.
