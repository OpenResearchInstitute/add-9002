## Project Report

### Plan for the Week

#### FPGA Work

FPGA Stand-up held on 12 April 2022. Link to a video recording of the meeting is below.

##### Downlink Demo for DEFCON

##### HDL Coder (target M17 Uplink IP cores)

#### Potential IMS2023 Participation

IMS2023 is the IEEE International Microwave Symposium. It will be held in San Diego in 2023. We have an opportunity to demonstrate our work in the amateur radio activities portions of this very large event. We can and should submit papers as well. Now is the time to start looking at participating. This will be a very welcoming and enthusiastic event for our project and teams. 

#### AI/ML Working Group activity

The AI/ML working group meets on Wednesday, and will continue deliberations. 
We co-chair the AI/ML subworking group on "Safe Uses of AI and ML" and that kickoff meeting is Thursday. 
We have nominated Aeva Black from OSI as an outside resource. 
We have nominated Dr. Piero Bonissone as a guest speaker. 
These nominations are proceeding. 

#### Taxes Underway

Our Dark Horse Accounting accountant is on the job and has everything he needs so far in order to complete the work. 

#### Government Grant Committee Formation and Charter

As previously discussed, we need to dilute previously received large grants down a bit in order to stay a public charity (also known as a 501(c)(3)). Anshul Makkar has agreed to be a lead of a Grant Committee, responsible for searching out and defining government grants our work and mission is best suited for. 

#### Technical Track at Ham Expo September 2022

We have the opportunity to hold our quarterly technical advisory meeting, which often features a list of speakers, at Ham Expo in September 2022. This would be a half-day track.
