## Project Report

### Plan for the Week

#### FPGA Work

FPGA Stand-up held on 12 April 2022. Link to a video recording of the meeting is below.

##### Downlink Demo for DEFCON

We're now changing the modcod on the fly, over the air, with the PLUTO build. 

SR-1 Pro has been added to the lab. DecTek boardsets are operational. Receiving DecTek on the SR-1 stalls at the transport stream. Subject matter experts are looking at it. 

##### HDL Coder (target M17 Uplink IP cores)

Bitstream successfully created three different ways, and all three ways fail in testbench simulation after the bitstream is loaded. Operator error or misconfiguration is suspected. Tech support called in to give advice and the entire network setup has been double-checked. We're not far from FPGA-in-the-loop capability through MATLAB. 

#### Potential IMS2023 Participation

IMS2023 is the IEEE International Microwave Symposium. It will be held in San Diego in 2023. We have an opportunity to demonstrate our work in the amateur radio activities portions of this very large event. We can and should submit papers as well. Now is the time to start looking at participating. This will be a very welcoming and enthusiastic event for our project and teams. 

#### AI/ML Working Group activity

The AI/ML working group meets on Wednesday, and will continue deliberations. 
We co-chair the AI/ML subworking group on "Safe Uses of AI and ML" and that kickoff meeting is Thursday. 
We have nominated Aeva Black from OSI as an outside resource. 
We have nominated Dr. Piero Bonissone as a guest speaker. 
These nominations are proceeding. 

"Safe Uses of AI and ML" kickoff meeting was a success, and ORI volunteers will be involved in contributing towards reports and advice that will go to the FCC TAC. The TAC advises the US FCC. 

Two additional speakers were contacted and invited to share their views in upcoming committee meetings. 

#### Taxes Underway

Our Dark Horse Accounting accountant is on the job and has everything he needs so far in order to complete the work. 

#### Government Grant Committee Formation and Charter

As previously discussed, we need to dilute previously received large grants down a bit in order to stay a public charity (also known as a 501(c)(3)). Anshul Makkar has agreed to be a lead of a Grant Committee, responsible for searching out and defining government grants our work and mission is best suited for. 

#### Technical Track at Ham Expo September 2022

We have the opportunity to hold our quarterly technical advisory meeting, which often features a list of speakers, at Ham Expo in September 2022. This would be a half-day track. 

#### Technical Assistance

We've been asked to provide software programming support for an open source DVB-S2 project, and have agreed to provide this support. 

#### Enclosures for Multimedia Beacon

We now have five enclosures for multimedia beacons. Here's a short video tour:
