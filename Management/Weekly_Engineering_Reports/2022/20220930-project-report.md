# Project Reports

## Presentations

Ribbit was at DEFCON. Ribbit was at Ham Expo. 

Ribbit will now be at RATPAC!

If you could please save the date for 20 October 2022 at 6pm US Pacific, then Pierre et al will present and take Q&A in the emergency communications track Radio Amateur Training Planning and Activities Committee (RATPAC). 

This is an all-volunteer group that puts on two presentations a week about amateur radio. Wednesday nights are general interest, and Thursday nights are emergency communications.

#### Supercapacitors

Kit donated.

#### Rechargeable Batteries

Battery packs from Nickel Metal Hydride cells will be created. These will be used as the initial battery packs for the engineering model. This work will complete the Cell Matching project. 

#### Solar Panels

Flexible panels from Northrup Grumman will be modeled and quoted.

#### Power Controller
