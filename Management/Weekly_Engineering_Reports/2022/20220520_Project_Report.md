### Components Engineering

47 GHz transponder components engineering proceeding. Advice received on exact frequency plan within the band for uplink and downlink. RSGB suggests 47.088 as the narrowband activity center. 

### Grants and Fundraising

It is 5 days until the next SBIR/STTR NASA solicitation round.
Let’s take some time and sort through the solicitations and see what we qualify for.
We have a fantastic community and volunteers that would like to do meaningful work.
Applying for SBIR/STTRs as the research institute or non-profit is one way to accomplish this goal.
I’ll post the announced solicitations, but if you want to keep track, then the webpage to go to is here:

A large grant application is proceeding with a potential project partner, and we look forward to announcing good news this year. 

Our dedicated fundraising portal (from Commit Change) is set up and will be used for several campaigns revolving around unique items. It's also available to any project that uses ORI as a fiscal sponsor. 

### Event Planning
