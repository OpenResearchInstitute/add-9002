## Weekly Project Report

### Ribbit

### M17 Talks and Demo

Thank you to everyone that attended the University of San Diego IEEE Student Branch Meeting on 3 May 2022 and the PARC/IEEE Information Theory Society Chapter event on 4 May 2022. Talks went well, with feedback incorporated for a final version to be recorded next week. The talk is about the forward error correction in M17.

The demonstration was MD-380 HTs running OpenRTX firmware and a PLUTO running M17 flowgraph from GNU Radio. An audio file was played from the PLUTO. Another monitoring station was an SDR with OpenWebRX receiving M17. Demonstration was successful. 

### FPGA Progress

Weekly meeting video can be found here: https://youtu.be/HuM8DQUAkAY

Encoder refinements occurred, with updates to extract config from data stream to a specific block, cleaning up code, adding and mapping random seed to testbenches, and removing references to polyphase filter. 

Preparations for demonstrating the encoder at DEFCON are underway. 

### Components Engineering

Components for 10 GHz transmitters and 47 GHz transceivers for Phase 4 Ground Digital Multiplexing Transverters (P4DX) kicked off with assistance from San Bernardino Microwave Society. The frequencies and bandwidths for 10 GHz are from the Air Interface Document. See https://github.com/phase4ground/documents/blob/master/Engineering/Requirements/Air_Interface/Air_Interface.md

For 47 GHz, the band is 47.0 to 47.2 GHz. There are some narrowband occupancies in the low side. We are going to prototype some 47 GHz gear with an uplink being lower in frequency than the downlink. These frequencies are TBD and your input is welcome. 

### Paper Review

The M17 filter design, to be demonstrated on the MD-380 HTs with OpenRTX firmware, is described in a draft paper by Wojciech Kaczmarski. Please visit the #general Slack channel to get a copy for review. Comment and critique welcome and encouraged. 

### Grant Proposal Reviewed and Submitted

We received a request to partner for a grant, reviewed the grant proposal, and the grant proposal has been submitted. 

### Fundraising for IRS Public Support Test

The previous item, if successful, will increase the amount required to raise in order to meet the public support test from the IRS.

### Sounding Rocket and GEO Experiments

Preparations for two sounding rocket tests and one GEO experiment are in progress. All results will be published when the launches and experiment are completed.
