Paul KB5MU has a Jupyter Notebook to put together BBFrames for the encoder. It will be published soon. 

### Uplink Receiver

Opulent Voice forward error correction article will be in a national publication - coming very soon. 

## Haifuraiya

Article follow-up sent to JAMSAT Editor. Review draft seen - it's going to look great! 

### Power Bus

Power systems, power budget, and power dissipation determinations are in progress. Thank you to Thomas Parry, Michael KA2ZEV, and Samudra for ongoing contributions.

#### Rechargeable Batteries

Battery packs from Nickel Metal Hydride cells will be created. These will be used as the initial battery packs for the engineering model. This work will complete the Cell Matching project. 

#### Solar Panels

Flexible panels from Northrup Grumman will be modeled and quoted.

#### Power Controller
