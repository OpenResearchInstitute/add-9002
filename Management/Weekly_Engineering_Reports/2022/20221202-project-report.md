Michelle Thompson will co-chair the AI/ML Safe Uses sub-working group, attend as a member of the AI/ML Working Group, and report back on the work of all other groups represented in TAC. Thank you to everyone that helped us contribute.

## Karen Rucker - Director Emeritus
Thank you to Karen Rucker for serving ORI as Director for the past two years. Karen has stepped down due to her increasing workload at Ball Aerospace and the demands of graduate school. She has been instrumental in ORI's success over the past two years providing leadership, direction, humor, and spine. Karen, along with Ben Hilburn, are recognized as Directors Emeritus by ORI. This is an honorary position that indicates our deep respect and appreciation for their service. 

Karen writes, "I'm continually impressed at the progress that ORI has made... I wholeheartedly believe in the values and goals that ORI strives for - and if there is any way I can help in the future, please let me know." 

It's safe to say we all feel the same way in return. 

We'd like to keep the number of people on our Board of Directors at 5, or more. If you've been thinking about serving the organization as a Director, then please consider yourself invited to apply. Send a letter of introduction and any other credentials you think might be relevant (a resume, portfolio, or recommendations) to hello at openresearch dot institute. The time requirements are not onerous, but they are non-trivial. Ethics is prioritized and a familiarity with Agile Frameworks and variants is a plus.
