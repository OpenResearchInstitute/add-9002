Uplink (re)design continues. OPUS high-rate CODEC with RTP being explored. These datastreams will be received and multiplexed onto the downlink. 

#### Encoder

Our encoder is integrated into the reference design from ADI, and is on the PLUTO in Remote Lab West (keroppi). 
Our encoder has been integrated into the reference design from ADI in Remote Lab UK.
Our encoder is in the process of being integrated into the reference design from ADI in Remote Lab South.

### Remote Lab South

Budget allocated; planning continues. Some of the Lab equipment in storage in NorCal will arrive at Remote Lab South as soon as practical. 

### Ribbit Updates

Working; demo on Slack. UX improvements are happening. 

### FCC TAC 

Next full meeting of the FCC Technological Advisory Committee is early June with content due 3 June. Weekly AI/ML working group assignment on Bandwidth metrics and how AI/ML will affect policies concerning Bandwith is proceeding with the assistance of our FCC liaison.

### Components Engineering

47 GHz transponder components engineering proceeding. Most work has to happen in person at the monthly SBMS meetings. We'll continue to attend these meetings in person whenever possible for at least another year.

### Grants and Fundraising

SBIR/STTR NASA study session revealed a lot of very interesting things. We're on the right track. Let's keep it up.

A large grant application is proceeding with a potential project partner, and we look forward to announcing good news this year. 

Our dedicated fundraising portal (from Commit Change) is set up and will be used for several campaigns revolving around unique items. It's also available to any project that uses ORI as a fiscal sponsor. 

### Event Planning

#### Friedrichshafen 24-26 June 2022

M17, OpenRTX, and Evariste's work on FGPA encoder designs for P4DX will all be at the show this year. See https://www.hamradio-friedrichshafen.com/ for more details. If you are going to the show, please find the M17/OpenRTX booth in the hall. 

#### DEFCON will be August 11-13, 2022

In-person demonstrations of everything we have working, plus we discussed whatever doesn't, and why. 

#### Ham Expo will be September 17-18, 2022

Virtual event with booth and multiple speaking track. Has been a very successful event for ORI. 

#### ORI will be the November 2022 program for San Bernardino Microwave Society. 

Update about ORI's work and in-person demonstrations. 

#### HamCation 2023?

Anshul and Art are interested in going. We'll need more people to commit in order to be a formal part of the show.
