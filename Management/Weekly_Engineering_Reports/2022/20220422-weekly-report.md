## Weekly Report

### Community Support

We have been asked to help an established open source DVB-S2 project with software programming. This sort of thing is why we were founded. It's a privilege to be able to solve problems in high-tech amateur radio. Our mission is to help individuals and organizations take full advantage of modern communications protocols and techniques. We do this in a free and open source manner. We look forward to publicizing the results of the work in the near future. 

### FPGA work for Transponder

The weekly FPGA meetup video can be found here:

Substantial progress with modcod agility. The implementation on the PLUTO is working over the air. 

Remote Labs UK is bringing up the encoder on their hardware (zc706/ADRV9371)

Remote Labs West added the SR-1 Pro to the lab. The how-to-use video can be found here:

Goal: end-to-end demo over the air for DEFCON in mid-August 2022. 

HDL Coder is stalled out with FPGA-in-the-Loop throwing an error at the final stage. Mathworks support has been contacted. The error occurs in three different contexts. We suspect it must be a known problem that we will be able to mitigate. The error message is not specific enough for Remote Lab staff to narrow it down. 

### M17 Support

Matlab script for M17 encoding reviewed and items that need work have been identified. This feeds into HDL Coder for end-to-end demo support.

Two talks about the forward error correction in M17 will happen. The first is on 3 May 2022 at University of San Diego and the second will happen on 4 May 2022 as a joint event hosted by Palomar Amateur Radio Club and IEEE Information Theory Society. There will be a video recording of the presentation. 

M17 will be at Friedrichshafen this summer, at IMS2023 next year, and everywhere else we can get a toehold for this exciting and innovative work.

### FCC TAC AI/ML 

We summarized the Wednesday AI/ML meeting on Twitter. Root of thread is here:

We were given permission to publish recordings of the FCC TAC working group and sub-working group AI/ML meetings.

### Fundraising

Taking large grants "only" is dangerous for a 501(c)(3) under current IRS law. If we are to continue as a 501(c)(3), we need to have a third of our funding come from small donors. We are doing all we can to achieve this, but given the current landscape in amateur radio, this is very difficult. If you have fundraising experience, then we need you. We have a plan and need more human resources. If you know of a Private Foundation that would accept ORI as a Private Operating Foundation, then get in touch. This would be a valid and weclome solution. 

If you just want to let us know you like what we do, let us know. ORI is run entirely by volunteers and your feedback makes a positive difference to all of us doing, and enabling, the work.
