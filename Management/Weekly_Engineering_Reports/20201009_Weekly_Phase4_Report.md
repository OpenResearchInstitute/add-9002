Delinquent documents with California Charity Registration have been filed and the status resolved. Filing for Charity Registration before receiving the tax ID was the root cause. 

The M17 (https://hackaday.com/2020/10/02/m17-aims-to-replace-proprietary-ham-radio-protocols/) needs to be compared against the AXM0F243 for uplink radio architecture. Both/and certainly possible, but the M17 is much further along than the AXM0F23 architecture. *Help needed here!*

UBA5-44 (advanced function battery analyzer) was donated for ORI lab. The first project will be a NiCd cell matching experiment lead by Douglas Quagliana to re-create and document work done by Larry Kayser VA3LK.
