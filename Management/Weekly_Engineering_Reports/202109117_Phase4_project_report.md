### Engineers General Program

Engineer General is a scaleable concept for a corps of highly competent open source workers that broadly serve a community. This initiative was kicked off with two grant applications to ARDC. More are in development. This initiative pays for full and part time open source positions (1099 proposed) *and also* produces a white paper on 1) motivations 2) concerns 3) compensation requirements and 4) retention of paid open source workers. This area of inquiry and documentation is understudied and underappreciated, but could be the key to improving sustainability, diversity, and health of open source work. As open source work increases as a presence in critical infrastructure and also in the economy, it becomes crucial to understand what it takes to hire and retain quality open source workers. 

### Regulatory Work

Implementation guideline meeting with legal team for ITAR/EAR work was held on 9 September 2021, with draft FAQ, notice, and training proposal expected this week.

Topic
Deep Learning and FPGAs, Today and Future Direction: A Wide-Ranging Discussion on Design Trade-offs, Open Source Benchmarks, and CAD Research

Description
Deep learning (DL) is rapidly becoming the cornerstone of many applications, creating an ever-increasing demand for efficient DL processing. FPGAs offer unique properties such as their fine-grained reconfigurability and diverse IOs which allow the use of arbitrary precision, direct hardware execution and low-latency connection to sensors and networks. These features make FPGAs appealing for DL acceleration in both datacenter and edge use cases.

In order to realize the full potential of FPGAs as Deep Learning (DL) accelerators, optimization of FPGA architectures and CAD algorithms is required. Benchmarks play an important role in this optimization process, but current open-source benchmarks are not representative of today's DL workloads.

In this webinar, we will discuss the trade-off between design customization and time-to-solution for DL acceleration on FPGAs. Then, we will present recent innovations and future trends in FPGA architecture and tools driven by DL as a key workload. One such tool is the Koios open-source benchmark suite specifically targeted for DL. These benchmark circuits cover a wide variety of accelerated neural networks, design sizes, implementation styles, abstraction levels, and numerical precisions.

### Space and Satellite Symposium - Amateur Radio and Information Theory

#### ORI's first self-hosted event

Planning progress and CFP at https://www.openresearch.institute/space-and-satellite-symposium-the-role-of-information-theory-in-space-with-special-emphasis-on-amateur-radio-and-amateur-satellite/

Volunteer signup at https://forms.gle/DZbtKGB4WzCTfWKv7

Registration open at https://events.vtools.ieee.org/m/280774

Thank you to IEEE Information Theory Society San Diego Chapter for hosting this event. Additional co-hosts from Computer Society and Aerospace Society are in the works, and an application has been made to designate the event as an Information Theory Society co-sponsored event. There are no proceedings for this event. All talks will be recorded and available to registrants after the event concludes.

### Xilinx Adapt Conference

We were granted permission to attend the Aerospace talks from Xilinx Adapt. This required signing an NDA as proprietary details will be discussed in the talks. Summaries of things not under NDA can be found on ORI Slack. 

### Space Computing Conference (IEEE) follow-up

Slide decks continue to come out from the SCC held in late August. A collection will be uploaded to the documents repository. Lots of RISC-V and FPGA work was covered in the conference. ORI is definitely on the right track with the work we are engaged in. There are a lot of opportunities to collaborate out there in the academic and industrial world visible through the presentations at this conference. 

### Openrotor

We need to have regular meet-ups for this part of the project. We need a volunteer to take this on. There's progress on the initial mechanical review and on narrowing the focus on parts.
