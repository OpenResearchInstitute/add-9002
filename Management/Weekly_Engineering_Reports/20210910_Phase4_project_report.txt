### Open Source FPGA Webinar attended 9 September 2021

Topic
Deep Learning and FPGAs, Today and Future Direction: A Wide-Ranging Discussion on Design Trade-offs, Open Source Benchmarks, and CAD Research

Description
Deep learning (DL) is rapidly becoming the cornerstone of many applications, creating an ever-increasing demand for efficient DL processing. FPGAs offer unique properties such as their fine-grained reconfigurability and diverse IOs which allow the use of arbitrary precision, direct hardware execution and low-latency connection to sensors and networks. These features make FPGAs appealing for DL acceleration in both datacenter and edge use cases.

In order to realize the full potential of FPGAs as Deep Learning (DL) accelerators, optimization of FPGA architectures and CAD algorithms is required. Benchmarks play an important role in this optimization process, but current open-source benchmarks are not representative of today's DL workloads.

In this webinar, we will discuss the trade-off between design customization and time-to-solution for DL acceleration on FPGAs. Then, we will present recent innovations and future trends in FPGA architecture and tools driven by DL as a key workload. One such tool is the Koios open-source benchmark suite specifically targeted for DL. These benchmark circuits cover a wide variety of accelerated neural networks, design sizes, implementation styles, abstraction levels, and numerical precisions.
