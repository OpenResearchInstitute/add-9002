## Meeting Reports

### Office Hours Openrotor

### Office Hours M17


### FPGA Standup

Over the past week, followed up with contacts and conversations from DEFCON and volunteered as an organizer at Ham Expo. 

Started training on Petalinux, specifically the version from Xilinx, started work on a Polar Code project proposal for deep space work, and started advocating for HDL for M17. 

Next week is getting signals over the air in the lab from the Analog Devices dev board, continuing the process of getting equipment moved from Florida and settling up the last details of the lab equipment purchase in the Bay Area. Both of these will increase the resources of remote labs. 

At this point, roadblocks are primarily logistics.
