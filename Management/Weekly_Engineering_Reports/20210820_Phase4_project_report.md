FPGA development from Anshul, Suoto, Thomas, and more can be found in the Weekly Report playlist. Look for FPGA Stand-up. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSfJ4B57S8DkZry2dr5tS0YVff1opWZjA

## Ham Expo Involvement

We had a booth and multiple talks at Ham Expo. Thank you to Eric Guth, Brad Grob, Emanuela, and the rest of the Ham Expo team for excellent support. Find some of the recorded content at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSfJ4B57S8DnS6XjcH3N4OyMRd3Vizd3B

## DEFCON 

Our first in-person board meeting since the start of the pandemic was held at DEFCON 29. Minutes have been published on the website at https://www.openresearch.institute/about-open-research-institute/

## Meeting Reports

We met with ARDC to talk about developer support and this lead to two grant proposals to be submitted in late August and early September 2021.

### FPGA Standup

Over the past week, followed up with contacts and conversations from DEFCON and volunteered as an organizer at Ham Expo. 

Started training on Petalinux, specifically the version from Xilinx, started work on a Polar Code project proposal for deep space work, and started advocating for HDL for M17. 

Next week is getting signals over the air in the lab from the Analog Devices dev board, continuing the process of getting equipment moved from Florida and settling up the last details of the lab equipment purchase in the Bay Area. Both of these will increase the resources of remote labs. 

At this point, roadblocks are primarily logistics.
