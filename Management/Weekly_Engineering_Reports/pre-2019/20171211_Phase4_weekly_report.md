Michelle W5NYV be in the Bay Area, USA, 12-16 December for two talks. 

The first one is: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/holiday-party-and-tech-talk-amateur-radio-satellite-tickets-39940914350

It's a holiday party! Come if you can.

The second is at the Foothills Amateur Radio Society Membership Meeting on Friday, December 15. There's a raffle!

All are welcome. This one will be about 3d printing in amateur radio. 

17 December - January 8th Michelle will be on a reduced schedule due children's school vacations. Best case she'll get a lot of video work to document what we've been up to. 

There's a lot going on in the first quarter of the new year for us, with some team members visiting us here San Diego (and getting some work done), very promising meetings at UCSD with Phil Karn's rapidly growing student satellite team, some campaigning at UNLV with Ed, and travel to the northwest to visit several team members up there (to get some work done). 

In the new year we will also have a full schedule for the first time, a #badgelife prototype, and some user interface prototypes for the radio. 

Please set aside some time to devote to Phase 4 Ground after the holidays. We need you, you're appreciated, and we can't do it without you.
