Remote operation is one of the most talked about and most requested feature in amateur radio. 

Remote operation enables performance improvements (one can put the radio closer to the antenna and put the antenna in the best possible location), allows more comfortable and flexible operating positions (operate from your iPad by the pool), and dramatically increases potential coverage area (remote stations can be located where they provide more public service). 

Remote operations are a great way to learn about radio, networking, reliability, and protocols. They are a big educational win. The problem is easily defined and arguably the performance can be easily measured, but there is plenty more to be done to improve the current state of the art in remote operations.

We want to define what we're doing for remote operations that doesn't reinvent the wheel or hold us back. 

Linux has several time-tested tools and applications. There are some proprietary solutions. There's a lot of DIY remote operations. A lot of you have experience setting up remote operations. 

Here's where we want to start.

What works? What is solvable? What is not currently solvable?

What should necessarily be included in Phase 4 Ground radios for successful remote operations?

Steve Conklin is our linux platform lead and is very interested in getting this right. Please help him with your feedback and input.
