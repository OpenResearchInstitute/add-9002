This is a Phase 4 Weekly report! Weekly goals went fruit-basket turnover, and two big opportunities presented themselves.

This week, follow along as the GNU radio flow graph for the Symposium Demo is modified to change bands and replace the codec with CODEC2. 

Successful DVB-S2 loopback tests were reported.

A big technology announcement is coming soon, and please join AMSAT and ARRL. Without them, projects like Phase 4 simply wouldn't exist. 

Spring break is coming up, so we'll see you on the other side!
