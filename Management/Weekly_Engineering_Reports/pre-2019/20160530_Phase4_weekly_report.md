This is a simple demo, but it's a great start for the terrestrial work. Recent positive steps have been taken in terms of coming to agreements with AHA to support the payload, ground terminal, and CQC with DVB-S2 technology.

We had a very successful presence at Dayton Hamvention in Mid-may. We helped staff the AMSAT engineering booth on Friday and Saturday, and Phase 4 Ground was the keynote speaker for the AMSAT/TAPR Friday evening annual banquet. We supported the AMSAT forums midday on Saturday, had several meetings with current and potential partners, did a lot of recruiting, explaining, and carrying on, and made substantial forward progress on several technical fronts. The upcoming issue of the AMSAT Journal has complete coverage of all the AMSAT action at Dayton Hamvention. A big thank you to everyone that came to the banquet. It was an extremely enjoyable experience and an honor to speak. 

The next meeting and presentation was at Qualcomm Incorporated on May 27th. Bob N4HY spoke about the payload and I spoke about the ground terminal to an invited audience of ham radio enthusiasts. Bob provided a riveting history of AMSAT and described how important Qualcomm has been in support of past payloads and satellites. Kathy's work at Dixon Lake was highlighted and we got to catch up with old friends and colleagues after all the talky bits concluded. 

The Wireless Symposium at Virginia Tech starts this week, and quite a few of us will be there. We will be able to get some work done in person with at least four other organizations that are actively involved with Phase 4 Ground. I'll share all that I can next week. I'm not presenting, but Bob definitely will be.

We responded to the call for presentations from DEFCON's wireless village. DEFCON will be held in early August. This is an excellent opportunity for a demonstration and feedback.

More results were shared from the 5GHz uplink team. Mike Sequin reports that he finished building up a pair of buffer amps to use between a HackRF and Skyworks amp. The buffer is providing plenty gain.

Mike is working with Paul Wade W1GHZ and they in the process of building up Paul's proposed dual band feed design. They're going to machine it up and test it out. 

There are some big improvements announced for Jabberd2, which is one of the components we have identified to use in the server space of Phase 4 Radios. The Jabberd2 team is actively discussing and reviewing the updates and improvements. 

Eric Nichols has expressed interest in writing up an article for AMSAT Journal about the topside ionospheric sounding scientific experiment proposal. We don't expect 4B to include this experiment, but we are looking to raise awareness about these sorts of experiments in order to improve our chances of putting together additional payloads. 

Kerry N6IZW, who attended the Qualcomm meeting, has agreed to help design and prototype a transverter for the BladeRF, so that we can better use this particular SDR in experiments and potentially in recipes. 

We have a draft web page and a design review for that coming up soon. It can only help to have a findable friendly face on the web. While some of us may be totally ok with using github, we really could use a landing page. In the future, this can provide status, manuals, links for buying hardware (yay!), a FAQ, etc. 

Please give feedback on the page. You can find the draft in the github here:

We have an offer of wordpress from AMSAT's Joe Fitzgerald, and we have an offer of hosting at both AMSAT and Virginia Tech. What we most need to do is make sure it says and does what we want.

Updates to the Air Interface document were made in the areas of interoperability, justification, and emission type designation. The payload team has edits and questions, but I haven't received them yet. I'm hoping to not leave Virginia Tech without them.

Franklin Antonio asked about phase noise, and that's something I think we need to spend some time on. The payload team has some initial results in terms of what they're expecting to see, and one of my goals for the upcoming Symposium is to follow up on how they arrived at their numbers, and how that affects us.


There are a lot of SDRs out there and more on the way. At least one Phase 4 Ground volunteer has an early version of the LimeSDR in hand, and if you've been following their blog, they seem quite intent on being relevant in amateur radio.

As of today, they are 64% funded with 21 days to go.

As Hackaday noted, "What makes LimeSDR interesting is that it is using Snappy Ubuntu Core as a sort of app store. Developers can make code available, and end-users can easily download and install that code." 

If this sounds familiar, it's because we're on a similar track. I think it's the right track.

After the Virginia Tech trip, it's back in the lab until August. There's a pile of very interesting work to do. I have no doubt that we'll get substantial expert advice on what the next steps should be for blocks and hardware. 

At a very minimum, we will be looking at how to best integrate generic stream encapsulation into the gnu radio flow graphs we currently have running. Whether we can integrate or use an existing library or codebase, or would be better off writing our own, is one of the next things we will be looking at in the San Diego Lab.

More soon!

If you haven't joined AMSAT or ARRL or TAPR, then please do. We can't do this without their support, and you get fun stuff for joining. Tell them I sent you and you'll pay full price!
