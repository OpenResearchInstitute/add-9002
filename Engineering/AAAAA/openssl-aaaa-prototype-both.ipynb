ITU X.520 https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.520-201910-I/en specifies the format, a Relative Distinguished Name. One of the ways this can be specified is with a Private Enterprise Number, which is a dot-separated sequence of numbers starting with `1.3.6.1.4.1` and followed by a number from the Enterprise Numbers list maintained by IANA at https://www.iana.org/assignments/enterprise-numbers/enterprise-numbers, plus some further sequence of numbers specified by that enterprise. The number for ARRL is `12348`, and they've apparently assigned `1.1` to mean amateur radio callsign.\n",

    "We've demonstrated that we can use the ARRL's LoTW public key infrastructure to securely authenticate our callsign identity and sign messages, and the payload can verify their authenticity without needing to know any of ARRL's secrets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The security here is, of course, limited by how secure ARRL's authentication of licensed radio amateurs is. In the United States, ARRL sends a postcard to the applicant's FCC-registered mailing address. That's as secure as anything the Federal government uses for amateur radio licensees. That may not be saying a whole lot, but there's no point in us trying to be more secure than the licensing body. For amateurs outside the United States, ARRL requires them to email images of proof of their license status. Presumably ARRL looks at these documents and perhaps cross-checks them with available databases when possible. This is roughly the same amount of scrutiny the FCC would give to reciprocal license applicants, so I think we can be reasonably assured that this is sufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other limit on security is the individual amateur's ability and incentive to keep their private key a secret. Logbook of The World also relies on this. If a private key is known to be compromised, certificates can be revoked and reissued. I don't know how often that happens, or how difficult the procedure might be. If our payload is to automatically take advantage of this mechanism, it would have to perform some transactions on the Internet for each certificate verification. That wouldn't necessarily have to happen in real time.\n",
    "\n",
    "A payload with full-featured Authentication and Authorization needs to have the capability to maintain a block list of stations not permitted to use the system. The need to handle revoked certificates cleanly points to a requirement that the block list be able to distinguish between permanent blocks on a callsign (say, for bad behavior) and blocks due to compromised private keys. Probably it would be enough if each blocked callsign also stored a date. Any certificates for that callsign older than the stored date would be rejected. Permanant blocks would just have a date in the very far future.\n"
